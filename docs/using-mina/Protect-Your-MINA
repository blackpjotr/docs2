# Never Share Your Seed Phrase, Private Keys, or Passwords

Your seed phrase (12-24 words), private keys and wallet passwords are the master key to your wallet. **Never share it with anyone** for any reason. It should be:
- Written down on paper (not stored digitally)
- Kept in a secure location (safe, lockbox, etc.)
- Never typed on websites or shared in messages
- Never photographed or screenshotted

# Avoid Common Scams

The crypto space has many types of scams. Here are the most common scams:

- **Discord or Telegram impersonators:** Scammers copy team names and photos to appear legitimate. Please note that no one from Mina will DM you first. Always check for verified badges, and when in doubt, confirm in public channels.
- **Impersonator Websites:** Scammers create convincing fake sites to steal your info. Always double-check URLs and bookmark official ones.
- **Malicious links or software:** Clicking unknown links or installing unverified software can compromise your wallet or device. Only download from official Mina sources and avoid connecting your wallet to unfamiliar sites.

### Follow General Security Best Practices

- **Use hardware wallets** for large amounts (Ledger)
- **Enable 2FA** on exchange accounts
- **Keep software updated** - wallet apps, browsers, operating systems
- **Use strong, unique passwords** for each service
- **Be skeptical** of urgent requests or pressure to act quickly
- **Verify everything** - double-check addresses before sending transactions
- **Start small** - test with small amounts when trying new services

**Remember: Crypto transactions are irreversible.** Once you send MINA, you can't get it back. Always take your time and verify everything.
